# First Fantasy
This is a choose your own adventure game where the player can pick who they want to be and play around in a fantasy world.


## How to install


## Current Features
- Branching origin stories and unique dialog for classes
- Lockpicking minigame with unique class interaction and difficulty levels for future use
- Functional inventory system that keeps track of names and quantities

## Future Improvements
For the future there are a few aspects I want to improve. The largest one being DIALOG. It isn't following DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself!)
This is something I want to fix eventually as it will allow me to make more immersive and branching dialog trees without taking so much space.

## Questions Outside of Assignment

Was there any spot outside my dialog that seemed like it could be improved? Organization is a struggle point for me, so I tried to keep things module and organized.
