# First Fantasy
This is a choose your own adventure game where the player can pick who they want to be and play around in a fantasy world.


## How to install
Unzip the folder and make sure you have the Java Coding Pack installed- if you don't, that executable is included in this set of files. Download that, and simply open the SRC folder and open main.java.
After that, hit the run button and enjoy! Type answers when prompted. e.g. Enter your name: Sam



## Current Features
- Branching origin stories and unique dialog for classes using polymorphism
- Lockpicking minigame with unique class interaction and difficulty levels for future use
- Functional inventory system that keeps track of names and quantities
- Fully functional GUI system

## Future Improvements
- I want to add try catch statements to ensure proper user input.
- I want to make the GUI look less default.
- Lockpick minigame needs to be implemented again. I really tried for hours and hours to get this in the event flow- but it got to the point where I needed to move on and turn in a completed product with or without it. (It looks good, just doesn't fit in my event flow yet)
- Dialog system is clunky and doesn't fully work as intended. It was fun to experiment with it, but will require major patching going forward.

## Comments About my Assignment
This project took me the longest out of all of them. I watch a lot of extra videos on JavaFX and had quite the difficult time figuring it out- but I'm happy with how it turned out!
Lockpick minigame is going to keep me up at night until I fully figure it out. GUI looks good, but I can't run it and keep things moving properly at this juncture.
